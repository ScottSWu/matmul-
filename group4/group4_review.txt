This report was well-written and perhaps more importantly, very clear. The different experiments considered were discussed briefly and the graphs included were fairly interpretable. The report was rather thorough in that it tried most of the suggested optimizations outside of vectorization. We were happy to see that this group achieved fairly strong performance using copy optimization, which was the area that our group explored least thoroughly. We hope to incorporate some of the lessons about copy optimization learned by this group into our final implementation. It was especially interesting to see the combined effects of blocking and copy optimization. Finally, many of the results achieved by the group for loop reordering and block sizes are consistent with the findings of our group.

In the future it would be nice to see some more exotic compiler flags represented. This group only tested the -o1/2/3 flags, of which one would expect -o3 would have the best performance. It would also be good to see vectorization explored. In general the report would benefit from more analysis of the experimental results presented, particularly in the section on looping order.
