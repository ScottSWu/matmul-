\section{Composing Optimizations}\label{sec:composing}
We also encountered issues when trying to merge differing strategies together.
Our attempts at modifying the loop order of j, k, and i didn't mesh with the
copy optimizations at all since the order of the loops dictated the access
patterns. For now we prioritized the copy optimizations because it was far much
more successful at increasing performance. We also had to modify where we did
the matrix transpose when we combined with blocking. Since we changed one
matrix to be row-major order, we had to modify how parameters were being passed
between the functions for blocking.
