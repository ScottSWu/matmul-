\section{Future work}\label{sec:future}
There are some further possible attempts at optimization that we would like to
try, but have not yet managed to implement in this first stage of the
assignment.

One thing we could possibly do is to more rigorously experiment with the block
size to determine which is fastest.

Another possible optimization would be to change how we handle the parts of
matrices that do not fit cleanly into blocks. Currently those are handled in a
naive way, but one alternative would be to pad the matrix with zeros so that
all (not almost all) multiplication occurs in consistently sized blocks. If the
multiplication of blocks is sufficiently well optimized, then this could be
noticeably faster.
