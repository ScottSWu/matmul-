\subsection{Vector Instructions}
After the copy optimizations, we tried to include explicit SSE instructions to
operate on multiple doubles at once. This, however, was unsuccessful. We
suspect the intel compiler already did a good job of leveraging vector
instructions since the performance only decreased when we tried to use methods
from xmmintrin.h. Although we did end up getting this implementation to work,
the added overhead and complications of using data types and operations from
xmmintrin.h only resulted in slowing down our implementation.
